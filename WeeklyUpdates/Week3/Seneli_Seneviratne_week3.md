#SENELI SENEVIRATNE WEEK 3 UPDATES

## List of Accomplishments

* brainstormed a project for this semester with the team (approx 3 hour meeting + 2 hours outside meeting doing research)

* finalized a project for this semester - at door mask detector, temperature sensor and contact tracing system
    * got it verified by the rest of our team
    * got Roger's approval
    * discussed potential complications we may have regarding temperature sensor hardware and brainstored solutions for it with the team. Decided that we will either be purchasing our [own temperature sensor](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Adafruit%20PDFs/4469_Web.pdf) or asking Prof. Green for money ðŸ™‡

* thought about what technology we will be using for our project and how to split it up so its easier to work on 
    * mask detection = 1 task
    * temperature sensor = 1 task (only done by person with sensor)
    * contact trace database + UI = 1 task (all can assist on this)
    * possible add ons to the project are listed [in this file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvoA9BHfWBHuFr_lcSfAWL0ZDv89R7bUhB8-zpyhEFo/edit?usp=sharing). Some suggestions are as follows. We will only explore these if the project proves too simple for us.  
        * QR code scanning for vaccine passport
        * student card scanning for carleton ID
        * websocket communication for voice calling - including an override case for unlocking the door. 

## List of Tasks for Week 4

* Organize our team a bit more so we have a weekly workflow and "to-do list" of tasks so nobody is left behind or left out. 
* Will introduce VSCode to my team on Thursday because that's just important to me and I think it could improve their workflow when working from a PC
* On Thursday make a timeline for our project + delegate tasks 
* Ask Prof. Green if we can pool our money for this project to get the sensor
    * figure out how our funding for this project works
