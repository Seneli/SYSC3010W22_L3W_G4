1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**

* I spent about 5 hours on this project this week. 
    * 3 brainstorming alone
    * 2 meeting up with my team about it and discussing which project we wanted to pursue

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**

    1. meeting with my team, 2 hours 
    2. brainstorming a project and what tech to use on it, 3 hours
    3. Writing my project proposal to the team up on [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvoA9BHfWBHuFr_lcSfAWL0ZDv89R7bUhB8-zpyhEFo/edit?usp=sharing), 30 min

3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_

    * brainstormed a project for this semester with the team (approx 3 hour meeting + 2 hours outside meeting doing research)

    * finalized a project for this semester - at door mask detector, temperature sensor and contact tracing system
        * got it verified by the rest of our team
        * got Roger's approval
        * discussed potential complications we may have regarding temperature sensor hardware and brainstored solutions for it with the team. Decided that we will either be purchasing our [own temperature sensor](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Adafruit%20PDFs/4469_Web.pdf) or asking Prof. Green for money ðŸ™‡

    * thought about what technology we will be using for our project and how to split it up so its easier to work on 
        * mask detection = 1 task
        * temperature sensor = 1 task (only done by person with sensor)
        * contact trace database + UI = 1 task (all can assist on this)
        * possible add ons to the project are listed [in this file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvoA9BHfWBHuFr_lcSfAWL0ZDv89R7bUhB8-zpyhEFo/edit?usp=sharing). Some suggestions are as follows. We will only explore these if the project proves too simple for us.  
            * QR code scanning for vaccine passport
            * student card scanning for carleton ID
            * websocket communication for voice calling - including an override case for unlocking the door. 

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

 - A bit worried that this project is going to be a lot of work but my team is super nice so I think its going to be a fun semester where we get to learn a lot of new tech.

5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_

    * Organize our team a bit more so we have a weekly workflow and "to-do list" of tasks so nobody is left behind or left out. 
    * Will introduce VSCode to my team on Thursday because that's just important to me and I think it could improve their workflow when working from a PC
    * On Thursday make a timeline for our project + delegate tasks 
    * Ask Prof. Green if we can pool our money for this project to get the sensor
        * figure out how our funding for this project works 
    
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_

    * need to find time to meet up and discuss a potential timeline.
