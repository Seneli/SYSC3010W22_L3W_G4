**_How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)_**

12

**_Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:_ (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)\***

- 4 hours - getting the email notification system up
- 5 hours - fixing up the client + RPI module to work better so they work for multiple systems and multiple users
- 3 hours - planning the video and working on a powerpoint for it

**_What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)_**

- I set up the email notification system in the RPI module. It doesn't work for mass notification but it does work to notify the owner. If I can get the mass notification system up today then I will do that :)
- The client and RPI module weren't set up to delete images from storage after each round. They also weren't sending pictures to the right named folders so I fixed that up as well and helped Deji get his firebase functions to work.
- I made all the general slides for the video with the rest of the team and started implementing our final powerpoint along with the talktrack we are going to use for each slide.

**_How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)_**

- Kinda nervous that we haven't yet tested every component working together but we do have 2 more days to test that out so hopefully we can get all of it done :)

**_What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)_**

- Test all units together - see if project is finally finished
- Finish making the demo video
- Get started on our final report
- FOR ME: try to implement mass notification (but this was agreed on to be a stretch goal from the start so it's fine if we don't get it)

**_Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)_**

- Still waiting on the mask detector, but it should be done as of today. We just haven't been able to test it together yet.
