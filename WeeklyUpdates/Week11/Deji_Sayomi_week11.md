     required.
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I feel good about it overall.
  - There were some frustrating moments trying to figure out ways to get the detector system reading
    from watching tutorials, dozens of stackoverflow.com articles, pyrebase not working, trial and
    error etc.
  - Eventually solved the issues and got things working properly 
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Integrate the mask detection system with the rest of the rapid screening system, completing the
     design implementation aspect of the project.
  - Work of final report

  - None
