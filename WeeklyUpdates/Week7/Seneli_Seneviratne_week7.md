1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**

    1. Designed Front end - 2 hrs
    2. Created front end with React - 5 hours

3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_

    * Brainstormed project architecture together. 
    * Realized there's roadblocks for some of the modules T_T 

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

 - I feel like this week made us re-assess our design plan a lot which either sets us a bit ahead or slightly behind where I thought we were. I think I know how to move forward from here though which is great.
 - I'm also getting nervous about the temperature sensor + mask detection modules. We will have to work on those soon.

    1. I will finish the UI for this project this week. 
    2. I will help set up the database (probably firebase) this week. 
    3. I will set up a connection from the UI to the DB this week. 
    4. Finish the detailed design document
