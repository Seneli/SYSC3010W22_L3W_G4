***What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)***
- Ironed out the details of our project
- Chose what components we will needs and which ones we are using.

***How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)***
- I really like our proposal. I felt working on that helped make planning decisions. I feel like it made us really prepared for the upcomming weeks.

***What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)***
- Setup small meetings during the week to talk about progress. Since Deji is MIA, seneli already kinda do this. But really adding a time slot somewhere in the week would be good.
- Start working on the UI.
- Start working on computer vision. Try and make the pi cam recognize a face. not just pizel changes

***Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)***
- Not at the moment. We really need to buy our temperature checker ASAP.
