## Weekly Individual Project Update Report
### Group number: 4
### Student name: Deji Sayomi
### Week: 10 (Mar 21 - Mar 27)

1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? 27 hours 

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Top item: Mask detection module, 21 hours
   2. 2nd item: Technical memo, 4 hours
   3. 3rd item: Meeting with team, 2 hours
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - 1. Completed the mask detection module. Experimented with different object detection libraries and tutorials. Much of the time was spent debugging, 
    and installing new functionality. Most did not work. I finally found one that worked and modified it for our puroses.
  - 2. Completed the tech memo
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - Very relieved to get the mask detector working. This required an all nighter to get it complete in time for the unit test. Many previous attemps weren't working and I was beginning to get concerened I would not be able to complete it on time.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Add more functionality to the mask detector. In adition to being able to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not, I want it to be 
    able to detect when a person is wearing a mask but not covering their nose. The detection box should then flash amber and prompt the user 
    to adjust their mask.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - None
