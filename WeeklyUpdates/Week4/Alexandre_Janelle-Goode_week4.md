***How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)***

3 hours

***Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:* (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)***

- 2 hours of working on the preposal, and ironing most of the details of our project

- 1 hour of researching components that we might need. Which server we will use, what database we will use.

***What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)***
- Ironed out the details of our project
- Chose what components we will needs and which ones we are using.

***How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)***
- We didn't do too much since there was some other assignments and projects we had to get done. So I'm not too happy since we didn't do too much. Atleast we didn't do nothing.

***What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)***
- Setup small meetings during the week to talk about progress. Since Deji is MIA, seneli already kinda do this. But really adding a time slot somewhere in the week would be good.
- Start working on the UI.
- Start working with the PiCam. Even just plugging it in.

***Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)***
- Not at the moment. 3rd team mate would be nice. sigh
